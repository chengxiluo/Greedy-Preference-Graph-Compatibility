# Greedy-Preference-Graph-Compatibility

Code to evaluate preference judgments as defined in Chengxi Luo, Charles L. A. Clarke and Mark D. Smucker. [*Evaluation measures based on preference graphs.*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3462947) ACM SIGIR 2021.

## Abstract
This thesis proposes a preference-based evaluation measure to compute the maximum similarity between an actual ranking from usersâ€™ preferences and an ideal ranking generated by systems. Specifically, this measure constructs a directed multigraph and computes the ordering of vertices, which we call the ideal ranking, that has maximum similarity to actual ranking calculated by the rank similarity measure. This measure is able to take any arbitrary collection of preferences that might include the property of conflicts,  redundancies, incompleteness, and diverse type results (documents or images). Our results show that Greedy PGC is matches or exceeds the performance of evaluation measures proposed in previous research.

## Usage

```
python greedy_pgc.py prefs <preference-judgments> run <actual-running/ranking>
```
